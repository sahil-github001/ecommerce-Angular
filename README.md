# ShopLift Ecommerce Webpage

ShopLift is an ecommerce webpage built with Angular, Bootstrap, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It allows users to search for products, add them to their wishlist or cart, and checkout.

## Features

- Header component: The header contains a search bar where users can search for products. It also has two buttons for wishlist and cart.
- Product component: The product component displays all products in a card format. Each card shows the image, category, price, rating, and two buttons to add the product to the wishlist or cart.
- Wishlist component: The wishlist component displays all products added to the wishlist. Users can remove a product from the wishlist or add it to the cart from this component.
- Cart component: The cart component displays all products added to the cart. Users can clear all items from the cart and proceed to checkout. The checkout button opens a modal where users can input their address details (no backend logic implemented).
